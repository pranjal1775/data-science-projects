# Task 2: Deep Learning Project – Image Classification

## 📌 Objective
To build a deep learning model using TensorFlow for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

## 🧠 What It Does
- Loads and preprocesses MNIST image data
- Builds a neural network with TensorFlow
- Trains the model and evaluates performance
- Visualizes accuracy, loss, and predictions

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

## ✅ How to Run
1. Open `DL_Task2.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run each cell step-by-step
3. Check the prediction visualizations
4. (Optional) Load `mnist_model.h5` for later use
